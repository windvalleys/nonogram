This is my Nonogram Puzzle Game!
You can play a randomly generated puzzle, create your own, or play another 
user's personally created puzzle.

Make sure everything is in the same folder and run the file called 'main'.

All libraries needed are imported at the begining of the 'main' file.

No shortcut commands exist.

No fonts need to be installed.
